  "Balancing pleasure and health is no easy task, especially for hedonistic New Yorkers in their mid-20’s. How does one properly rectify chain smoking Camel Blues and pouding pitchers of light beer with friends on Wednesday? Well the answer might simply be this: eat vegan for lunch on Thursday.",
  "I work in mid-town which has an abundance of salad bars stock piled with mediocre dressing and halal carts strewn with mediocre meat. Both are fine options for lunch on any given day, but today I must satisfy both parts of my brain - the pleasure seeking and the health minded.",
  "The only thing that could properly fulfill this is a vegan meal at 5th ave.’s Japanese Sunrise Mart.",
  "Sunrise Mart is awesome for a lot of reasons. For one, there’s plenty to eat. There’s counter service which delivers soups or stir-frys, and a refrigerated section full of bento-boxes and sushi rolls. You’ll also find a grocery section in the back which has all the japanese essentials you could ever want. It’s New York’s best large-scale Japanese Bodega as far as I’m concerned.",
  "I walk across 40th st. past the New York Public library and realize I forgot where this place was. I carry a flip phone and an iPod but I didn’t have wi-fi so I couldn’t look up the address. Thankfully the associate at Muji told me it was just around the corner. I said thanks, took a right out the door and there I was, right at the foot of Sunrise Mart.",
  "I immediately began my quest for my vegan lunch in the refrigerated section full of bento-boxes. Nearly everything I saw there had meat, and I wasn’t going to eat a seaweed salad for lunch, although I do love the thing.",
  "I pivoted to the counter area and scanned the menu. There are a ton of options - yaki-soba, japanese curry, ramen - but not a lot of vegan ones. The only thing that seemed to fit my hedonistic vegan bill (or “hegan” for hedonistic vegan) was Vegetable Tempura Soup with Soba Noodles, which obviously wasn’t a problem because it sounded awesome.",
  "While they cook my order, I scan the rice triangles section and linger on the one with kara-age (fried chicken). I deny myself the pleasure and opt to just wait for my Kaki-age soba. I deduce in the meantime that “age” must mean fried in japanese.",
  "Soup in hand, I walk out the door and head up the steps of the New York Public Library towards Bryant Park. ",
  "Yesterday I ate one of those aforementioned midtown salads in Bryant Park alone. As I ate leaf after leaf, I scanned the crowd and looked for what I deemed to be “the richest person in Bryant Park.” I ended up calling it a tie between two Finance Bros in their early 30s and and elder man who seemed to be on a questionable date with a younger woman.",
  "Now today, alone again in the park, I felt myself to be the richest person in Bryant Park, this time on the merit alone of my hegan Kaki-age soba soup.",
  "I pry open the plastic container and place two pizza-slice shaped pieces of the vegetable tempura in the soup. It’s a little bit like waiting for your cereal to soak in the milk. The first few bites were crunchier, the next few were a climax of softness, and by the end they disolve into soggy piece of fried vegetable. This journey of the tempura works well in the miso soup broth which by my accounts is completely vegan.",
  "I can’t say for certain whether tonight is going to be another chain smoking, binge drinking affair,  but what I can say is I’d eat that soba vegetable tempura soup any day of the week, hungover or not.",
